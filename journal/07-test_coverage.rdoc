=== Test coverage

As we are using ruby 1.9, we will use SimpleCov for test coverage.  The instructions at
https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov are perfect so we just follow them:

We already had gem "simplecov" in our Gemfile, so no need to change it.

Then to the top of spec/spec_helper.rb and features/support/env.rb we add:

    require 'simplecov'
    SimpleCov.start

And edit .gitignore to ignore the coverage directory:

    ∴ cat .gitignore
    .DS_Store
    .idea
    *~
    rdoc/*
    *.log
    coverage

Then run the specs and point your browser at coverage/index.html.

    ∴ brake spec
    ∴ open -a /Applications/Safari.app coverage/index.html

And repeat for the features:

    ∴ brake features
    ∴ open -a /Applications/Safari.app coverage/index.html
